Allll righty, this is the first time writing since the ole baby was born! It wasn't known that we'd have the child two days later.. It was a wild ride. My back held up enough through labor and delivery that it wasn't to bad.

I didn't, and haven't, made any progress in anything (besides less back pain). So, this is a somewhat disappointing update I suppose. It'll be short and sweet in that sennse.

I haven't started reading that book that I wanted to. It's still in my night stand drawer, and I'm having a hard time finding the time to do so... It's feeding, soothing for sleep, napping and eating. There's not a lot of time left in the day for me honestly. Now, with beginning to work again, I'll have even less time IMO. Only time will tell to be honest.

Even though the update is small, and not super greate... I'm here, and writing some words, which is a win I think. I'm also still learning the vi/vim environment/commands, so that's progressing.

So, signing off until the next update.. Jan 4, 2021.
